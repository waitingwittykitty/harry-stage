Apptomator No-code platform is a Business Process Management (BPM) software that integrates workflows with multiple other applications, systems, technologies, and human elements. Apptomator BPM represents multiple workflows and processes and supports the total business process improvement cycle.

With Apptomator No-code capabilities such as visual components for software development which streamline the entire process to hasten delivery.

You can learn more about it [on its official website](https://apptomator.com).

Apptomator is largely composed of the admin system and the client website. The admin system provides various tools to create and manage the website. The client website displays the pages created by the admin system.

As an advanced developer, I participated in both the admin system and the client website development. By building various user-defined components, which are the basic parts of the admin system, administrators can add them to their website without any inconvenience. In particular, the map component I made with my own hands received enthusiastic reviews from users as soon as it was added. In addition, I took on important parts in the development of this platform, such as the page and template preview feature, the feature to remove and optimize repeated styles, the schedule management feature, and the database hooks, and solved it without compromising.
