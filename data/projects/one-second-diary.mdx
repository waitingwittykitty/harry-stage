This app was inspired by this [TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/cesar_kuriyama_one_second_every_day).

The idea itself is pretty simple:

1. Open the app at the moment of your day that you would like to remember in the future
1. Tap the Record button and save the video
1. That's it, open the app the next day and repeat the process
1. Then, after a couple months or even years, tap the button to generate a compilation of all those videos, creating the movie of your life
