Argon2 is a key derivation function that was selected as the winner of the 2015 Password Hashing Competition.

I used Web Workers and Promise and optimized the algorithm for BigInt operation to make the operation speed 12 times faster than before.

I recommend to use the [Passky](https://passky.org/) of [the Rabbit company](https://rabbit-company.com/) which is based on this app.

You can learn more about it [here](https://blog.rabbit-company.com/2023/01/06/why-you-should-choose-a-password-manager-that-uses-xchacha20-and-argon2id).

Argon2id is more secure than SHA for hashing. I hope it will replace SHA in the near future.
