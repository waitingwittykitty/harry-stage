MetaVirus is a blockchain mobile online game targeting traditional gamers. Here, players can catch and collect almost any kind of deadly virus that exists in the world today and help human scientists create and nourish the viral antibodies through experiments. Then, players can lead the antibodies to fight back against the virus that threatens humankind.

In this world, it has two design principles: **F2P** (Free to Play) and **P2E** (Play to Earn), where players can acquire game credits by obtaining, holding, and using VIRUS tokens that are unique to the game platform.

The idea for ​​the virus theme in MetaVirus came from two inspirations: one is the novel coronavirus that started in 2019 and, due to the proliferation of numerous variants, is still bringing illness and misery to communities around the world well into 2022. The other inspiration came from the concept of "viral marketing". Our hope, through the creation of MetaVirus, people around the world can take a break from the powerful enemy we are enduring. We also hope the game spreads quickly through a marketing model designed to imitate a real virus and ultimately serves a huge number of players.

The MetaVirus game environment will be divided into 6 categories of tokens:

1. **VIRU (viral currency)**: Homogeneous Tokens; used in the external system of the game; used for DAO governance rights management, purchase of in-game tokens AG, purchase of pre-sale assets, etc.

2. **AG (antigenic currency)**: Homogeneous Tokens; currency used in the entire internal system of the game.

3. **Proof of resource property rights**: Non-Fungible Tokens; game graphic resources, such as icons, original paintings, vertical paintings, scene maps, 3D models, animation files, interface resources, lighting effects, etc.; game text resources, such as story background, dialogue content, character introduction, game content description, etc.

4. **Combat attribute items**: Non-Fungible Tokens; including virus genes, characters, nanochips, skills, etc.

5. **Proof of assets**: Non-Fungible Tokens; laboratory ownership, regional management rights, land ownership, etc.

6. **Consumption points**: Homogeneous Tokens; research points, honor points, prestige points, etc.

I was responsible for bridging MetaMask and the payment system in this project, and I did a great job on it. Currently I am working on a task to create an [introductory page](https://metavirus.netlify.app) for this game.
